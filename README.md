# Computer Architectures & OS Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects related to Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. 
The projects are designed to provide practical experience in low-level programming, assembly language, and C programming, and involve various computational algorithms and system-level operations.

## Project Structure for Computer Architectures

#### All the programs are as fast as possible (time complexity wise) and also have least amount of instructions

| File Name   | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `addsb.s`   | Assembly program that performs signed byte addition. |
| `binsearch.c`| C program implementing binary search algorithm.   |
| `bitrev.s`  | Assembly program that reverses the bits of an input value. |
| `clz.s`     | Assembly program that counts the leading zeros in a number. |
