# Computer Architectures & OS Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects related to Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. 
The projects are designed to provide practical experience in low-level programming, assembly language, and C programming, and involve various computational algorithms and system-level operations.

## Project Structure for Computer Architectures

#### All the programs are as fast as possible (time complexity wise) and also have least amount of instructions. 
#### These files were core anwser to the problems stated in each project and were purely done by me.

| File Name   | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `addsb.s`   | Assembly program that performs signed byte addition. |
| `binsearch.c`| C program implementing binary search algorithm.   |
| `bitrev.s`  | Assembly program that reverses the bits of an input value. |
| `clz.s`     | Assembly program that counts the leading zeros in a number. |
| `matmult.c` | C program performing matrix multiplication.       |
| `mod17.s`   | Assembly program that calculates modulus 17 of a given number. |
| `texture.c` | C program related to texture mapping and graphical data manipulation. |
| `wbs.s`     | Assembly program counting a weight-balanced bit sum. |
| `ctarget.l1-l4` | Bytecode files used to manipulate code in order to exploit vulnerabilities. |
| `solution.txt` | Text file with all the secret phrases used to defuse the bomb. |
